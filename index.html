          Vim stands for Vi Improved. It is an open-source text editor that includes almost
          all commands from the Unix program "Vi". His author, Bram Moolenaar, relesed it 2 November 1991.
          Why Vim stands out is fact that all commands and
          navigation are done by using only the keyboard so you don't need to take your eyes away from the screen.

        <p>
          Vim has 12 editing modes, 6 are basic and the other 6 are variants of basic modes.<br>
          <ul>The most important modes are:
            <li>Normal mode: this is also a default mode and is used for editor commands.</li>
            <li>Insert mode: this is where you type text and is inserted into the buffer.</li>
            <li>Visual mode: functions like a normal mode with the difference that is highlighting text.</li>
            <li>Command-line/Cmdline mode: opens single line input at the bottom of the Vim window.
          Any operation is completed by pressing `Enter`.</li>
        </ul>
