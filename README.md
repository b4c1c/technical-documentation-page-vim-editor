This is Vim text editor Technical Documentation Page.

3/5 project from freeCodeCamp.org Responsive Web Design certification.
I wrote html and CSS code in Atom, but entire text and this README.md file are done using Vim text editor.
This repository is uploded on GitHub using CLI and is third part of my coding portfolio.

Project is live on following URL:
